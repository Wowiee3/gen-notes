## Ratings
#### Analphabetapolothology 3.5★
*by Cap'n Jazz*
The first impression is that the album was extremely long. It was about 1 and a half hours long in total, but that makes sense as the album was their entire discography up til that point. 
The album has a very raw sound, it's definitely post-hardcore. That mostly comes from the vocals though, as the instruments are not too heavy. Definitely reminiscent of Title Fight if they turned the guitar down. For some reason this sounded more Hardcore than Emotional.
I especially liked the cover songs like their Take On Me cover.
##### Standout tracks
- Sea Tea
- Take On Me

#### Lanquidity 5★
*by Sun Ra*
This is the type of album that when listened to, you could tell that it was extremely influential. As in, it sounds like everything here was borrowed and developed further by other songs. This album is everything I like about jazz. I like jazz because once you listen to jazz you can hear jazz in every other genre of music. And this album especially, it sounds like it was the great-grandmother of many other songs. You can hear Lanquidity in modern music: rap samples yes, vaporwave, jazz fusion, grunge... It was definitely influential.
##### Standout tracks
- There are other worlds (They have not told you of)
- Honestly every track is a standout

#### Merriweather Post Pavilion 1★
*by Animal Collective*
Perhaps this too was an influential album except I didn't get this one. It was released in 2009, so maybe it was ahead of its time. But honestly I don't like it because it sounds like every other album to come out today. It has that pop sound but it's just not executed well. I really didn't enjoy it, I didn't hate it but I was just so bored. I can't believe people liked this album so much. Maybe I'll have to revisit this but for now it's just not for me.
##### Standout tracks
- None, it was all so boring

#### The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady ★
*by Charles Mingus*

#### Bitches Brew ★
*by Miles Davis*

#### Aja ★
*by Steely Dan*
When I first listened to the track 'Aja', I realised this was completely different to 'Can't Buy a Thrill' and I wondered if Steely Dan had completely changed their music. But then I heard 'Deacon Blues' and felt relieved. Because while 'Aja' was a nice song, it made me sad and I missed their groovy sound. 'Aja' was so melancholic, I felt almost scared. But when I heard 'Home at Last' I actually felt emotional.
