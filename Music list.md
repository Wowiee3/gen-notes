## Ratings
#### Analphabetapolothology
*by Cap'n Jazz*
The first impression is that the album was extremely long. It was about 1 and a half hours long in total, but that makes sense as the album was their entire discography up til that point. 
The album has a very raw sound, it's definitely post-hardcore. That mostly comes from the vocals though, as the instruments are not too heavy. Definitely reminiscent of Title Fight if they turned the guitar down. For some reason this sounded more Hardcore than Emotional.
I especially liked the cover songs like their Take On Me cover.
##### Standout tracks
- Sea Tea
- Take On Me
